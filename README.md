## Mapping Multimorbidity Clusters
This methodology estimated the causal relationships among prevalent diseases and mapped out the clusters of multimorbidity progression among them. It was used in a recent paper: Han, S., Li, S., Yang, Y. et al. Mapping multimorbidity progression among 190 diseases.

# Overall methods

The methodology involves estimating the impact of one disease on the risk of another using targeted maximum likelihood estimation (TMLE) to create a disease causal effect chart. Diseases are then clustered based on development patterns, and key diseases in and out of the progression of multimorbidity are identified. Additionally, the methodology explores bi-directional and uni-directional one-step progression, mapping progression across disease classifications and clustering disease progression to construct progression constellations.
